//! The runtime library for reactor programs generated by LFC,
//! the [Lingua Franca](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca) compiler.
//!
//! Most of this crate consists of types that are manipulated
//! only by the generated code. User-written Rust code mostly
//! interacts with the type [ReactionCtx], which is the entry
//! point for user documentation.
//!
//! Crate-level features include:
//! - `parallel-runtime`: use Rayon to execute reactions in parallel
//! when possible. This is off by default. For some applications,
//! where there is no data parallelism, this may harm performance
//! (as well as pull in unneeded dependencies) and should stay off.
//! - `no-unsafe`: disable optimisations that use unsafe code in this runtime.
//! Just provided for comparison, should probably be removed (unsafe code is fine).
